Business Performance & KPI Analysis - Analyzes business KPIs to reveal misleading performance indicators by comparing revenue, profit, and discount-driven sales using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

# Business-Performance-KPI-Analysis

## Business Performance & KPI Analysis (Python, SQL & Power BI)

## Overview
This project analyzes retail business performance to uncover hidden profitability challenges behind strong revenue numbers. Using Python for data processing, SQL for business analysis, and Power BI for interactive visualization, the project reveals critical insights about category performance, discount strategies, and regional efficiency.

## Objectives
- Analyze revenue vs profitability across categories and regions
- Evaluate discount strategy impact on profit margins
- Identify high-revenue but low-profit business areas
- Build interactive Power BI dashboard for data-driven decisions

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI
- DAX

## Key Insights
- Furniture category: $742K revenue but only 2.5% profit margin
- Discounts above 30% consistently create losses
- West region (14.9% margin) vs Central region (7.9% margin) - 7-point gap
- Potential profit improvement: $135K annually (47% increase)

## Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize KPIs, revenue trends, category performance, regional analysis, and discount impact with dynamic filters and drill-down capabilities.

## Business Recommendations
- Optimize Furniture category pricing to target 10% margin
- Cap discounts at 20-25% to prevent profit erosion
- Apply West region best practices to improve Central region performance
- Add profit margin as primary KPI alongside revenue
